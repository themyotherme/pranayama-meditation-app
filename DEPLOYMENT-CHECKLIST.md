## 🐛 Common Deployment Issues & Fixes

### **Issue 1: 404 Errors for JSON Files**
**Symptom:** Programs don't load, console shows 404
**Fix:** Ensure `examples/` folder is included in deployment

### **Issue 2: CSS Not Loading**
**Symptom:** No styling, plain HTML
**Fix:** Our CSS is inline, so this shouldn't happen. If it does, check HTML file deployed correctly

### **Issue 3: JavaScript Not Loading**
**Symptom:** Buttons don't work, console errors
**Fix:** Check framework.js and ai-integration.js are deployed

### **Issue 4: Audio/Video Not Found**
**Symptom:** Media doesn't play
**Fix:** Include audio/ and video/ folders in deployment

### **Issue 5: CORS Errors**
**Symptom:** Can't load JSON files
**Fix:** Netlify handles this automatically, no action needed

## 🔧 Netlify Configuration (Optional)

Create `netlify.toml` in the generic-wellness-framework folder:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "."

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
    
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.json"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
```

This ensures:
- HTML always fresh (no cache issues)
- JS cached with versioning
- JSON files always fresh

---

## 📱 Testing on Mobile

After deployment, test on mobile:

### **iOS (iPhone/iPad):**
