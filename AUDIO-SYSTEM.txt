🎵 AUDIO SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT - COMPLETE! 🎵

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🎧 Smart Ambient Audio System
- **Exercise-Specific Ambients**: Different sounds for breathing, meditation, relaxation, energy, cooling, focus, sleep
- **Program-Specific Ambients**: Morning programs get meditation music, evening gets flute music, stress relief gets ocean waves
- **Dual Audio Support**: Uses your existing media files when available, falls back to generated Web Audio API sounds
- **Volume Control**: 30% default volume that doesn't interfere with voice narration

### 🎵 Generated Ambient Sounds
- **Ocean Waves**: Sawtooth oscillator with low-pass filter for wave-like sounds
- **Soft Drone**: Sine wave at A2 (110Hz) for peaceful background
- **Forest Night**: Triangle wave with filtering for nature sounds
- **Meditation Music**: Dual sine waves (A3 + E4) for harmonic meditation
- **Rain Sounds**: White noise with high-pass filter
- **Singing Bowls**: Sine wave at C4 (256Hz) with natural decay
- **Flute Music**: Sine wave at A4 (440Hz) for gentle melodies

### 🎛️ Audio Controls Panel
- **Volume Slider**: Real-time volume adjustment (0-100%)
- **Current Status**: Shows if ambient is playing
- **Test Buttons**: Try all 7 ambient sounds instantly
- **Auto-Play Settings**: Toggle automatic ambient during programs
- **Fade Controls**: Smooth fade in/out transitions

### 🔔 Enhanced Bell System
- **Layered Audio**: Bells play over ambient background
- **Smart Stopping**: Ambient stops 5 seconds after program completion
- **Volume Balance**: Bells are clear while ambient stays subtle

## 🎯 How It Works

### During Meditation Programs:
1. **Program Start**: Automatically selects appropriate ambient based on program type
2. **Exercise Bells**: Ring over the ambient (1 ring for exercise 1, 2 for exercise 2, etc.)
3. **Background Continuity**: Ambient plays throughout the entire program
4. **Program End**: Continuous bell + ambient fades out after 5 seconds

### Audio File Priority:
1. **Your Media Files**: `./media/ocean_waves.mp3`, `./media/soft_drone.mp3`, etc.
2. **Generated Sounds**: Web Audio API creates synthetic ambient if files not found
3. **Seamless Fallback**: No interruption if media files are missing

### Volume Management:
- **Background**: 30% volume (adjustable via slider)
- **Bells**: Full volume for clear audio cues
- **Narration**: Unaffected by ambient (if you add voice guidance later)

## 🎮 User Experience

### Easy Access:
- **Menu**: 🎵 Audio Controls in hamburger menu
- **Test Button**: 🎵 Test Audio button in program details
- **Real-time**: Volume changes apply immediately

### Smart Defaults:
- **Auto-Detection**: Chooses best ambient for each program type
- **Volume Balance**: Won't overpower voice or bells
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade in/out prevents jarring audio changes

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

The audio system is now fully integrated and ready! Users can:

1. **Start any program** → Ambient automatically begins
2. **Adjust volume** → Via Audio Controls menu
3. **Test sounds** → Try different ambients instantly
4. **Enjoy layered audio** → Bells + ambient + (future) narration

## 🎵 Perfect for Your Vision!

✅ **Exercise-specific ambients** (breathing = soft drone, meditation = forest night)
✅ **Program-specific ambients** (morning = meditation music, evening = flute)
✅ **Uses your media files** when available
✅ **Soothing instrumental background** that plays continuously
✅ **Layers with narration** (low volume background + clear voice)
✅ **Volume controls** for perfect balance

The audio system creates a truly immersive meditation experience! 🌟
